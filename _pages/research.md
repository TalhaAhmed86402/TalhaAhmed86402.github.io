Research Interests
------------------

I am currently an M.S. student at [DASH Lab](https://dash-lab.github.io/), Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), working with [Prof. Simon S. Woo](https://dash-lab.github.io/Professor). My research sits at the intersection of **computer vision**, **generative models**, and **AI safety** &mdash; in particular, **deepfake detection** and understanding how modern generative and vision systems can be made more robust and trustworthy. This builds on my earlier work at LUMS on **efficient generative models** for medical imaging and **inverse problems**, where I cared about both the theoretical foundations and practical deployment of these methods.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deepfake detection</strong> that generalizes to unseen generators, manipulations, and domains</li>
      <li><strong>AI safety &amp; security</strong>: adversarial robustness of vision and vision-language models</li>

      <li>Designing <strong>efficient generative models</strong> that avoid reliance on large pretrained backbones</li>
      <li><strong>Inverse problems</strong> and <strong>Model-Based Deep Learning</strong> (algorithm unrolling, structured priors)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Media forensics</strong>: detecting and localizing synthetic or manipulated images and video</li>

    <p class="author-name">with <a href="https://dash-lab.github.io/Professor">Prof. Simon S. Woo</a> &nbsp;·&nbsp; M.S. Research</p>
    <p>
      Joined DASH Lab as a master's student in Fall 2026, supported by the <strong>2026 Seoul Tech Scholarship</strong>. My work spans <strong>computer vision</strong>, <strong>generative models</strong>, and <strong>AI safety</strong>, with a primary focus on <strong>deepfake detection</strong> &mdash; building detectors that remain reliable as generative models evolve, and studying the robustness of vision systems against manipulation and adversarial attacks. More details to follow as projects mature.

      Theory and Practice of Diffusion Models in Medical Imaging and Inverse Problems

    <p>
      A research assistantship in which we systematically covered diffusion-based methods for inverse problems — <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572">BIRD</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14687">DPS</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10656">Blind-DPS</a>, medical imaging — <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03559">MedSyn</a> , <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18361">SDSeg</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16654">SSDiffRecon</a> —, and computational imaging settings — <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543">ControlNet</a> , <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07015">StableSR</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15070">DiffBIR</a> — and more. On the practical side, this culminated in <strong>Wave-GMS</strong> (ICASSP 2026): a ~2.6M-parameter generative segmentation model trained entirely on a consumer GPU (RTX 2080 Ti, 12GB VRAM) that achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

      Explored <strong>Model-Based Deep Learning</strong> through the lens of algorithm unrolling — bridging classical iterative solvers with trainable deep networks. Began with a reading course in High-Dimensional Data Analysis and Compressed Sensing (<a href="https://book-wright-ma.github.io/Book-WM-20210422.pdf">Wright &amp; Ma</a>), self-taught Duality Theory and the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), Proximal Gradient Methods, Convex Relaxation Techniques and applied these to the Matrix Completion (MC) problem.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented popular deep learning algorithms from scratch (<a href="https://github.com/TalhaAhmed2000/DeepLearning">GitHub</a>) and replicated key MC baseline results (<a href="https://github.com/Talha-Nehal-Undegrad-Study/M-estimation-RMC/tree/main">GitHub</a>)</li>
      <li>Built <strong>ConvMC-Net</strong>: an unfolded ALM network for standard matrix completion (<a href="https://github.com/TalhaAhmed2000/convmc-net">GitHub</a>)</li>
      <li>Proposed <strong>ConvHuberMC-Net</strong>: an unfolded <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682657">M-estimation</a>-based network for robust MC under impulsive / heavy-tailed noise (<a href="https://github.com/Talha-Nehal-Undegrad-Study/ConvHuberMC-Net">GitHub</a>)</li>

    <p class="author-name">with <a href="https://www.ihsanqazi.com/">Dr. Ihsan Ayub Qazi</a></p>
    <p>
      Built a digital literacy assessment app as a sequel to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352728523000015">published study</a> on validated digital literacy measures for low-internet-experience populations (Ali, Raza, Qazi — <em>Development Engineering</em>, 2023). The app evaluates a user's digital literacy score (0–1) from a structured questionnaire.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-taught the <strong>Shiny</strong> framework in <strong>R</strong> and explored model deployment techniques within it</li>
      <li>Deployed a <strong>Random Forest</strong> classifier as the scoring backend, tuned on validated survey responses</li>
      <li>Designed for communities with limited prior technology exposure — simple onboarding, low-bandwidth usage</li>
